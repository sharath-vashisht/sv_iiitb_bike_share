## General Information
Boom bike a popular bike sharing company is going under dip in their business during covid times and now it wants to understand the parameters that can be used predict the demand so that company can focus on the business once the Pandemic end.

This project analyzed the data shared by the boom bike and the conclussion is shared in the next section.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- From Data it is very clear that the business is increased significantly from 2018 to 2019 which indicates there is a great demand for the boom bike.
- Parameters like season, weathersit, monthly and yearly data analzyed
- Multiple linear regression algorithm is applied and following inference were derived:
  - Training data has R-squared value as 84.9%
  - Testing data has R-squared value as 85.1%
  - This shows model is a good fit and not overfitting and memorizing any data
  - High R-squared value signifies that there is a good increase in demand.
  - Variables like:Temperature, season, humidity and weather condition are highly relevant and plays major role in the business.
